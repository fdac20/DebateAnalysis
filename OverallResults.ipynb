This could mean that talking about the candidates rather than the issues could negatively impact a candidate's performance in an election. While Jimmy Carter says Gerald Ford's name more than vice versa, but it may have proven more effective in that race because of the Watergate scandal and the Nixon Pardon. </li>\n",
